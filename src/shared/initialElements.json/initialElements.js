However, we strongly believe that legal representation is critical in immigration cases, and do not encourage you to file any immigration applications without the assistance of a qualified attorney.

Over the years, we have encountered many clients who automatically became U.S. citizens at birth, but had no idea they were citizens.&lt;/span>&lt;a href="https://bordercrossinglaw.com/news/firm-proves-citizenship-of-client-facing-deportation-2" target="_self">&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">You can read about one of these cases here.&lt;/span>&lt;/a>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;"> &lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">We can review your case, help you determine if you acquired citizenship, and if you qualify we can help you get a Certificate of Citizenship (Form N-600) and U.S. passport.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">The most common way that someone proves citizenship is if they are born here.  But, you can also become a citizen at birth -- even if you were born outside the country -- if one or both of your parents was a U.S. citizen. The laws about transmission of citizenship have changed a lot over the years, and we will need to collect information about you and your parents to make the determination.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">You can also become a U.S. citizen automatically if one of your parents naturalized while you were under 21.  In *rare* cases, it is possible to aqcuire U.S. citizenship based on your grandparents, where they passed citizenship to your parents and they passed it on to you.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">We will collect all of the information you have, and reference the laws at the time of your birth, to give you an assessment of whether you acquired U.S. citizenship. &lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">We will likely need information that is contained in your government immigration record, which is called an “alien file.”  There are also several government databases that contain information about your entries and exits from the country, any applications you were a part of, and any times you have interacted with immigration enforcement.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">We handle assessments regarding acquisition of U.S. citizenship on a flat fee basis, and charge $500 for the whole process. We will begin work on your case immediately, and work to get it filed without delay.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">Our flat fee includes:&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">* Being available by e-mail, phone, and video to answer your questions.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">* Access to our online portal to collect your information.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">* Drafting the relevant forms to gather your immigration file (if any), and sending them to you for signature.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">* Reviewing the FOIA results with you to determine if they answer our questions.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">* Providing our assessment of whether you acquired U.S. citizenship and can apply for a certificate of citizenship or a passport.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;span style="font-size: 14px;">After the payment is made, we will e-mail you an Attorney-Client Contract that you can sign electronically.  Then, we will e-mail you a link to our online intake form, as well as a checklist of items to start collecting.&lt;/span>&lt;/p>\n',

Otherwise, a single continuous trip of six months or more might be considered an abandonment of residence with potentially serious consequences.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If you are interested in obtaining U.S. citizenship eventually, it is important to maintain documentation of every entry and exit from the United States, which you will need for an eventual naturalization application.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>In addition, a legal permanent resident *is not authorized to vote* in any election, so please do not register to vote, and be careful when renewing a driver’s license to not accidentally check any box that registers as a voter.  If you vote, this is considered a false claim to citizenship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Similarly, please be careful on job applications and other paperwork to never accidentally sign something that says you are a U.S. citizen, as making this claim even by accident can have serious consequences.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If you have any kind of interaction with law enforcement, whether it is an arrest or simple citation, it could have immigration consequences.

TPS will also allow you to get a work card.  &lt;/p>\n&lt;p>TPS is a temporary benefit that does not lead to lawful permanent resident status or give any other immigration status. &lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Some federal courts previously believed that TPS counted as an admission, and some applicants were able to adjust their status. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously decided that TPS *does not* count as an admission. Therefore, your options for getting a different status in the country are the same as anyone else who illegally entered the country.&lt;/p>\n',

There are a few ways to do this.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>**No Objection From Home Country**&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>It is possible to request that your home country government issue a "No Objection Statement" through its embassy in Washington, DC. The letter must state your government has no objection to you remaining here. There is a procedure to submit this to the Department of State ("DOS”) and obtain a waiver from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS").&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>**Extreme Hardship**&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If you can show that your departure from the United States would cause exceptional hardship to a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident (LPR) spouse or child, then you can apply for an exceptional hardship waiver. &lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If our basis for the waiver is “extreme hardship” on the U.S. citizen spouse, we will first file Form I-612 with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS”) to establish this hardship. If/when this is approved, we will submit DS-3035 to the DOS.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>To establish extreme hardship we will have to dig into any special hardships that exist for your family. Current conditions in your home country may play into that, but only if those conditions pose some specific risk to you.  &lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Also, please consider what other hardships you may experience. Some of the factors in analyzing extreme hardship are as follows: age, family ties in the U.S. and abroad, length and residency in the U.S., health and medical conditions, conditions in the country of removal (economic and political), and ties to the community.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>**Persecution in Home Country**&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If you can demonstrate that you will be persecuted in your home country on account of your race, religion, political belief, or social standing, then you can also apply for a waiver for this reason. Because this is similar to a claim for asylum, it is difficult to obtain a waiver this way unless we can provide a lot of evidence to support the claim.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;strong>We handle J-1 waiver requests on a flat fee basis, and charge $1,000/month for two months, for a total of $2,000. We will begin work on your case immediately upon the first payment, and work to get it filed without delay.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Our flat fee includes:&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Being available by e-mail, phone, and video to answer your questions.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Access to our online portal to collect your information.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Drafting all of the relevant forms, and sending them to you for signature.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Providing checklists and direct support to help you collect the required supporting documents.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Submitting your application packages to all relevant government agencies.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Responding on your behalf to any requests for evidence. &lt;/p>\n&lt;p>After the payment is made, we will e-mail you an Attorney-Client Contract that you can sign electronically.

        "&lt;p>&lt;strong>You have been arrested or convicted of a crime inside or outside of the United States.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>As a general matter, you can be inadmissible or deportable from the country if you are convicted of committing all the essential elements of certain offenses.  These include:&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Offenses designated as “aggravated felonies” under immigration law.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Offenses related to controlled substances (drugs).&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* What are known as “crimes involving moral turpitude.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>There is a large body of case law from the U.S. Supreme Court, the Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”), and various U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal regarding what crimes make you deportable or inadmissible. Unfortunately, it would be impossible to cover all of these in our guide.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>A “categorical” analysis set forth by the U.S. Supreme Court governs the immigration consequences of a conviction.  This analysis can get complicated, but simply put, the rule is that the immigration consequences of a conviction are based only on the *elements of the crime* you were convicted of, not neccesarily the *specific facts* of what happened.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Therefore, when evaluating the immigration consequences of a criminal conviction, the government is required to begin its analysis by looking only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the  offense, rather than to the particular underlying facts.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The inquiry focuses on whether the elements of the statute of conviction establishes an “evil intent” or purposeful bad conduct.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If the statutory elements of an offense are too broad, so that someone could be convicted under that law even if they didn't to anything with evil intent, then the entire offense may not make you deportable or inadmissible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>A “conviction” for immigration purposes is any formal adjudication of guilt with any form of penalty or restraint.  Therefore, a conviction includes a guilty plea, even if there is a suspended or deferred sentence, because it includes an admission of guilt and a form of penalty or restraint on liberty.  A “no contest” plea is still a conviction for the same reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>A deferred sentence is also usually going to be a conviction for immigration purposes.  A deferred sentence typically includes a guilty plea, but even if an adjudication of guilt is withheld, and even if the sentence is entered but will be set aside upon completion of certain conduct, it is still a conviction for immigration purposes provided any form of punishment, penalty, or restraint whatsoever was imposed. A guilty plea and imposition of probation, a fee, any jail, or any counseling of treatment requirement will create a conviction for immigration purposes, even if the plea is later withdrawn upon successful completion of these requirements.  Therefore, any guilty plea can trigger the same immigration consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>However, there is no conviction for immigration purposes if a charge is dismissed.  An acquittal, or a deferred prosecution, also do not count as convictions.  A deferred prosecution is when criminal proceedings are postponed and then later dismissed by agreement of the parties, and there is no plea, verdict, or penalties of any kind.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is a complex area of the law, and review by an attorney is highly recommended.

        '&lt;p>&lt;strong>Reinstatement of Removal&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>When someone has been ordered removed, and then they illegally re-enter the country again, that first deportation order can be “reinstated.”  When a prior removal order is reinstated, it is as if you are automatically ordered removed again.  You don\'t even have the automatic right to see an Immigration Judge to ask for any of the forms of relief that are usually available in removal proceedings.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>There is no time limit on how old the original deportation order was -- it could be from decades ago, and still be reinstated.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>To reinstate a previouis removal order, your current entry has to have been illegal.  It makes a difference if you were granted a visa somehow (which is unlikely because of your removal order) or presented yourself for inspection and were waved in.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>You are only given an opportunity to see an Immigration Judge if you are able to show that you have a "reasonable fear" of returning to your home country.  This is largely the same as a request for asylum, with some differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If you are afraid of returning home because you reasonably believe that you will be persecuted, tortured or killed, you should immediately inform any Immigration and Customs Enforcement ("ICE") agent that you are speaking to. They are obligated to schedule you for a "reasonable fear" interview.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Another possible form of relief could come from challenging the circumstances of the first deportation order, as there could possibly be some basis to challenge whether that one was properly issued.  &lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>It is possible to appeal the reinstatement of removal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for your jurisdiction, if the underlying removal order was defective.  For instance, if you were not properly advised of your rights to voluntary removal instead of deportation, or if you were eligible for relief and were never told this, you can potentially get the original removal order invalidated.  In that case, there would be no order to reinstate.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>You can usually get a stay of removal while you challenge the removal order.  The problem with these appeals is that you will almost certainly remain detained for a prolonged period of time while you deal with this.  The U.S. Court of Appeals is not fast with these petitions — it can take many months.  Therefore, you must be prepared for being detained for months.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If you have no "reasonable fear" of returning home, and do not challenge the reinstatement of removal, you will have the deportation order reinstated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>A removal order makes you barred from returning to the U.S. for 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>But, by illegally entering after an order of removal, you will have also triggered the permanent bar to admission under INA 212(a)(9)(C)(i)(ll).&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>That means that you have to spend a full 10 years outside the U.S. before he can even *ask* for permission to come back in.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is a complex area of the law, and review by an attorney is recommended.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Please schedule a phone or video call with us to personally review your case and answer your questions.  We charge a $300 flat fee for a detailed consultation, up to an hour of time.

        '&lt;p>&lt;strong>You are detained in federal immigration custody.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Here is what to be aware of in your situation:  Initially after being arrested, you may be held for a few days at a state or local facility.  You will eventually be moved to a federal facility.&lt;a href="https://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/index" target="_self">Your loved ones can check where you are by using this online website.&lt;/a>&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Once you are in the federal facility, you or your attorney can request a bond hearing.  That is your chance to ask the Immigration Judge to release you from custody while you go through the removal proceedings and ask for any relief you can to avoid deportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>To be released, you have to post a "bond" payment.  This can be anywhere from $3,000 to $10,000 dollars (or more).  You only get this money back at the end of the proceedings, and they will set an amount that they think will make sure you attend.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Bond is not granted to everyone, and these days it has become more difficult to get an Immigration Judge to release you on bond.  If you have any criminal record, even a simple DUI, many Immigration Judges will deny bond.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>To have a chance at getting released, you will have to send the Immigration Judge documents to show that you are not a danger to anyone, not a risk of running away, that you have steady employment, and that you have family or friends that vouch for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>You should assemble things like the following to send to the Immigration Court:&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Birth certificates of any children.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Marriage certificate, if married.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Letters from friends, family, and employers. Ask people you know to write a letter to the Judge that explains how they know you and why you are a good person.  Ask them to explain why you should be released and why you should be able to stay in the United States. Make sure that each person writing a letter includes a copy of their identification with the letter, including a driver’s license, a permanent resident card, or a passport.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Pictures of you with your family.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Evidence of the time spent in the U.S. like rent receipts, utility bills.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Evidence that you own property in the U.S. Make copies of the deed to your home, car, or trailer. These can show the Judge that you have many ties in the U.S. and a strong reason to come to your court hearings.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Evidence about your ties to the community. If you attend church or volunteer with a school or other group, ask a leader at that organization for a letter. If that’s not possible, remember to tell the Judge about your community activities at the bond hearing.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;strong>This is a complex area of the law, and review by an attorney is recommended.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://bordercrossinglaw.com/services/removal" target="_self">If you need help, you can hire us to represent you in your removal proceedings!&lt;/a>&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n',

        '&lt;p>&lt;strong>Removal Proceedings in Immigration Court&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The first important step in the removal proceedings is the "master calendar" hearing.  This is a routine hearing where the Immigration Judge will want you to answer the charges in the "Notice to Appear" document that you were issued when proceedings started.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>(If you have never seen the Notice to Appear, then you will need to demand a copy before pleading to the charges.)&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>During your first appearance, you are usually allowed additional time to get a lawyer to help you, before you have to answer the charges.  If you request more time to get an attorney, the Immigration Judge should schedule a second master calendar hearing in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The main purpose of the master calendar hearing is to tell the Immigration Judge what relief you are asking for to prevent your deportation.  Then the Immigration Judge may set a deadline to submit the relevant application, or possibly set the final hearing date.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The final hearing is called the "individual hearing."  This will be a lot like a trial.  You will call your witnesses, and this always includes the person being deported.  But this can also include anyone else who has knowledge about the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The Department of Homeland Security will have an attorney there, who will also ask questions of you and your witnesses.  Their questions will be meant to try and confuse you, or point out reasons why you should not be granted the relief you are seeking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>At the end of the hearing, the Immigration Judge will make a decision.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Immigration Judges hear a lot of cases, and right now they are under pressure from the Department of Justice to deny them.  To succeed, it is very important to prepare ahead of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>You should send the Immigration Judge all of your evidence 30 days before the individual hearing.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>It is well known that Immigration Judges are more likely to grant relief to people who are represented by an attorney.

Under today\'s laws, you would be required to go through a process to forgive your illegal entry, and then have an interview at the U.S. consulate in your home country to return.  This is called the "hardship waiver" process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>However, there is an exception to this rule.  There used to be a law called INA § 245(i), which would allow you to pay an extra $1,000 penalty fee, and then you would be permitted to apply for a green card.  This law ended on April 30, 2001.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>However, if anyone ever submitted an immigration petition for you before April 30, 2001, you could still benefit from that law.

That petition has to be approved before you can ask the Immigration Court to grant you a green card.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The problem is that these days, Immigration Judges may not agree to give you the time you need to get that petition approved.  Without the approved petition from USCIS, you can\'t apply for the green card.  It is important to try and make sure you get the time you need by filing the petition quickly, and asking for a continuance of your Immigration Court case.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>After the USCIS petition is approved, the Immigration Court will hold a hearing to decide if you should be granted the green card.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We have been practicing immigration law for over 15 years now, and have helped hundreds of clients win their removal cases.  &lt;a href="https://bordercrossinglaw.com/about" style="color:#655a4e"; target="_blank"&gt;You can read about us on our website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We handle removal cases in Immigration Court on a flat fee basis, and charge $10,000.00 for the whole process.

            '&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Hardship Waiver Process&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Unfortunately, the hardship waiver process will not prevent you from being deported.  However, it could help you to return to the United States.  Therefore, it is good news that you have a qualifying relative who could help you with this.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>You must go through a process to "excuse" the fact that you have unlawful presence.  To get the government to approve your waiver, you must show that your family member would suffer "extreme hardship" if you got deported.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>For this process, they are not interested in hardships that *you* will experience — they are only concerned about the hardships to your family member(s).&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>This is not easy, because they do not believe that family separation, by itself, is enough to show extreme hardship. You must show some special medical, emotional, or financial impacts, and you must work very hard to assemble documents that will *prove* those hardships.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We will be glad to advise you on your options to make sure that you are choosing the correct path for you, and then take you through the entire process.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We handle this type of case on a flat fee basis, and charge $7,000.00 for the whole process.  You can pay the fee in seven monthly payments of $1,000 each.  We will begin work on your case immediately upon the first payment, and work on your case without delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>There are several steps in the process, taking over a year to complete, and many attorneys charge separately for the various stages.  We charge one flat rate to keep things simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Our flat fee includes:&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Being available by e-mail, phone, and video to answer your questions.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Access to our online portal to collect your information.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Providing checklists and direct support to help you collect the required supporting documents.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Submitting a Petition for Alien Relative (Form I-130) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS"), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS"). It may take at least 4-5 months to approve.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Upon approval of the Form I-130, the file is sent to the National Visa Center ("NVC"), which is within the Department of State ("DOS"). The NVC sends a request to pay some more fees. Those must be paid before moving forward.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* The NVC must be informed of the intent to apply for a Provisional Hardship Waiver (Form I-601A) to "excuse" the illegal entry.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Then we have to prepare and file a Form I-601A, along with specific proof all the hardship the U.S. citizen would experience if the foreign spouse was deported, or if the family relocated to another country. This proves eligibility for a hardship waiver.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* The approval of the I-601A acts as a “pre-approval” for a visa to enter as a lawful permanent resident, but you have to travel to the foreign country, obtain the visa, and return.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* You have to wait at least another 4-5 months to obtain a decision on the I-601A.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* If approved, then there are multiple final steps required to schedule an interview at the U.S. Consulate abroad.  There is a detailed online form called the DS-260 that must be filed online.  The NVC requires additional documents to verify that the U.S. citizen spouse can financially support the immigrant spouse.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>After the payment is made, we will e-mail you an Attorney-Client Contract that you can sign electronically.

            '&lt;p>&lt;strong>Applying for asylum from within the United States.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Asylum is a difficult form of relief to win.  Asylum may be granted to applicants who meet the definition of a “refugee” under our immigration laws. A refugee is a person who is unable or unwilling to return to their native country because of persecution (or a well-founded fear of persecution) on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Persecution occurs when the government, or someone the government is unwilling to control, inflicts punishment or harm for political, religious, or other reasons that this country does not recognize as legitimate.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>It is very difficult to win an asylum case, because even if the government believes that you are afraid of returning to your country, the laws are complex and only protect you if you are afraid for certain reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The government more easily accepts claims where a person has been threatened because of their race, religion, or political activities.  To show persecution on account of a political opinion, you must show that you hold (or the persecutors believe you hold) a political opinion, and you are afraid that you will be persecuted because of that opinion. When you didn\'t actual hold the opinion for which you are being persecuted, it is called an “imputed” political opinion.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>To be eligible for asylum, it is not *necessary* that the persecution be at the hands of the government.  Cases have recognized for a long time that persecution can also happen at the hands of private individuals that the government is unable or unwilling to control. However, it is becoming harder to win this type of asylum case.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Where the person is afraid because of violence from criminal gangs, it is important to be very careful in how you present the case.  In cases involving threats from gang members, you must explain what "social group" you are a part of.  A  social group is one united by either a voluntary association or some characteristic that is so fundamental to the identities of its members that they cannot or should not be required to change it. The group should generally be recognizable by others in the community.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Cases are often won or lost based on the explanation of the "social group" that you are a part of.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We handle this type of case on a flat fee basis, and charge $5,000.00 for the whole process.

        '&lt;p>&lt;strong> Cancellation of Removal.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Cancellation of removal is a special form of relief that is *only available* if you are already placed into removal proceedings.  It is not something you can apply for unless you are in front of an immigration judge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>To get cancellation of removal, you have to demonstrate the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* You were "continuously present" in the United States for at least 10 years.  If you left the country for more than 90 days, they consider that to be a break in your residence, and the clock starts over.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Your ten year presence stops once you are deported or served with a Notice to Appear in Immigration Court.  But, if that notice doesn\'t include a date and time of your hearing, the time continues until you get a notice that does.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* You have to show that you are a person of good moral character, and have no relevant criminal convictions.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Most importantly, you have to prove that your deportation would cause exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to your family who are U.S. citizens or green card holders.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The only family that they consider "qualifying relatives" are spouses, parents, and children who are U.S. citizens or green card holders.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Cancellation of removal is considered an "extraordinary" remedy, and Immigration Judges will not grant cancellation of removal unless you are able to demonstrate some significant hardships that your family will experience if you are deported.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Some things that Immigration Judges consider are:&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* If you have a spouse, parents, or children who have some special medical or emotional hardships.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* If you have children who do not know any other way of life than in the United States, or do not speak, read or write in the language of your home country.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* If you have a spouse, parent, or children who are entirely dependent upon you for financial and emotional support.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* If your ability to care for your family in the country of deportation would be substantially compromised, and their quality of life would be greatly diminished.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We have been practicing immigration law for over 15 years now, and have won dozens of cancellation of removal cases.  &lt;a href="https://bordercrossinglaw.com/about" target="_blank">You can read about us on our website.&lt;/a>&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We handle removal cases in Immigration Court on a flat fee basis, and charge $10,000.00 for the whole process.  However, you can pay the fee in ten monthly payments of $1,000 each.  We will begin work on your case immediately upon the first payment, and work on your case without delay.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>Our flat fee includes:&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Being available by e-mail, phone, and video to answer your questions.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Access to our online portal to collect your information.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Providing checklists and direct support to help you collect the required supporting documents.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* If the client is detained, filing a motion for a bond hearing, including detailed evidence to assist the client in getting released on bond.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Pursuing any available relief to defend the client in removal proceedings in Immigration Court.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Preparing and filing all motions, forms, and evidence submissions required to pursue the relief the client is eligible for.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Attending all bond and master calendar hearings by telephonic appearance.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Preparing the client for the individual hearing in Immigration Court.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Traveling to attending the Client’s final individual hearing in person in Immigration Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* Travel costs are included in this flat fee.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* After the Immigration Judge renders a final decision on your case, this representation will conclude.  Being available by e-mail, phone, and video to answer your questions.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>After the first payment is made, we will e-mail you an Attorney-Client Contract that you can sign electronically.

Although the law is called the Violence Against Women Act ("VAWA"), it applies to men as well as women.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>You must demonstrate that:&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* You resided with the abusive spouse.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* You were battered or subject to extreme cruelty during the marriage.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* The marriage was genuine, and was entered into in good faith.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>* That you are a person of good moral character, without any relevant criminal convictions.&nbsp;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>If the marriage has already ended as a result of the abuse, you can still submit a self-petition for two years after the marriage has ended.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We will help you develop all the evidence that you can, because this type of petition does not usually have a face-to-face interview.  For instance, a self-petition should always include a detailed written statement from you, describing what happened in detail.  Although it is hard to write about, it is helpful to explain the frequency of the abuse, and describe in detail how it affected you.  We can assist with this.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>When you are already in removal proceedings, the process involves filing a with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ("USCIS").  That petition has to be approved before you can ask the Immigration Court to grant you a green card.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>The problem is that these days, Immigration Judges may not agree to give you the time you need to get that petition approved.  Without the approved petition from USCIS, you can\'t apply for the green card.  It is important to try and make sure you get the time you need by filing the petition quickly, and asking for a continuance of your Immigration Court case.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>After the USCIS petition is approved, the Immigration Court will hold a hearing to decide if you should be granted the green card.&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We have been practicing immigration law for over 15 years now, and have helped hundreds of clients win their removal cases.  &lt;a href="https://bordercrossinglaw.com/about" style="color:#655a4e"; target="_blank"&gt;You can read about us on our website.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>&lt;/p>\n&lt;p>We handle removal cases in Immigration Court on a flat fee basis, and charge $10,000.00 for the whole process.  However, you can pay the fee in ten monthly payments of $1,000 each.
