    "description": "When pursuing a visa based on marriage or on another family-based category, you have several options available, each with pros and cons depending on your own unique circumstances.  If you are inside the United States, and were admitted to the country on a visa, you may have the option of applying from within the United States instead of from abroad. If you have not already spoken to us and confirmed eligibility, you may want to set up a consultation with us first.  If you choose to hire us after your consultation, we will credit the consultation fee towards the rest of the work. Once retained, we will advise you on your options to make sure that you are choosing the correct path for you, and then guide you through the entire process. We handle adjustment of status cases on a flat fee basis, and charge $1,000/month for five months, for a total of $5,000. We will begin work on your case immediately upon the first payment, and work to get it filed without delay.",
